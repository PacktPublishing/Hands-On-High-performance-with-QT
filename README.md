**Build cross-platform applications using concurrency, parallel programming, and memory management**

## What is this book about?
Efficient code achieved through performance tuning is one of the key challenges faced by many programmers. This book looks at Qt programming from a performance perspective. We will look at the performance problems encountered when using the Qt platforms and means and ways to nullify it and optimize performance.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Understand of classic performance wisdom 
Get to grips with modern HW architectures and their performance impact 
To implement tools and procedures used in performance optimization 
Grasp Qt-specific work techniques for GUI and platform programming 
Performant usage of TCP and HTTP and the relevant Qt classes 
Learn about improvements Qt 5.9 (and later) has in store for us 
Plan of Qtâ€™s architecture, strengths and weaknesses of graphics engines

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
QSignalSpy spy(tstPushBtn, SIGNAL(clicked()));  QTest::mouseClick(tstPushBtn, Qt::LeftButton);
QCOMPARE(spy.count(), 1);
```
